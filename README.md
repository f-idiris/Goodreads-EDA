# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Goodreads Data
In this project, I performed EDA using python on a dataset of books listed on Goodreads.

### Source
*books.csv* contains metadata for each book (book ID, title, author, average rating, number of pages, etc.)

This dataset was obtained from Kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks?select=books.csv
